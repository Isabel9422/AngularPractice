It consists of three different exercises, the first one consists in an app in which you could write your name and the app is going to greet you through a text which you can modify their font size, font family or even the alignment of the text.

Moreover, thanks to the calculator of this app you'll never have to waste your time opening calculator app of your phone or computer ! Besides it has a pretty design which will catch your child's attention so as to ease doing their maths homework.

Last but not least, the third exercise is a simulator of a bank transaction report in which you could sort transactions depending on different criteria and take a look of the details of each transaction.
